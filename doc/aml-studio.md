- Support for parameterized queries leveraging the `@` symbol. Parameters can be 
  either the entirety of a property or attribute or a portion of a SQL segment
  within a property or attribute

- Support for find/replace including a normal mode, extended mode (supports \r, \n, 
  etc.), Regex mode, and XPath mode.

- Many useful commands (e.g. viewing items, invoking actions, running reports, etc.) 
  can be invoked directly from the output editor's context menu
