# A better admin tool

Innovator Admin is a Windows tool for querying and administrating databases. 
It is the ideal tool for administrating Aras Innovator PLM systems featuring 
an advanced AML query editor (with full IntelliSense) along with streamlined 
tools for exporting solutions from one database and importing them into 
another (e.g. during DEV to PROD migrations). It is also quickly becoming a 
great tool for querying SQL Server databases (with IntelliSense for SQL 
queries) among other data sources.

# I want it

If you don't want to build the project from the source code, you can 
download the [latest release](https://github.com/erdomke/InnovatorAdmin/releases/latest) 
from GitHub. If you download and run the setup.exe installer file, 
the program should install and update automatically.

# Help me!
